## Introduction

Here are some of my technical notes presented with [Material for
MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), chosen for its [design
principles](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/philosophy/#design-principles):

> * **It's just Markdown**: Focus on the content of your documentation and create a professional
>   static site in minutes. No need to know HTML, CSS or JavaScript – let Material for MkDocs do
>   the heavy lifting for you.
>
> * **Works on all devices**: Serve your documentation with confidence – the underlying layout
>   automatically adapts to perfectly fit the available screen estate, no matter the type or size of
>   the viewing device.
>
> * **Made to measure**: Change the colors, fonts, language, icons, logo and much more with a few
>   lines of configuration. Material for MkDocs can be easily extended and provides tons of options
>   to alter appearance and behavior.
>
> * **Fast and lightweight**: Don't let your users wait – get incredible value with a small
>   footprint, by using one of the fastest themes around with excellent performance, yielding great
>   search engine rankings and happy users that return.
>
> * **Accessible**: Make accessibility a priority – users can navigate your documentation with
>   touch devices, keyboard, and screen readers. Semantic markup ensures that your documentation
>   works for everyone.
>
> * **Open Source**: Trust 45,000+ users – choose a mature and well-funded solution built with
>   state-of-the-art Open Source technologies. Keep ownership of your content without fear of vendor
>   lock-in. Licensed under MIT.

More specifically, I use the sponsorware edition [Material for MkDocs
Insiders](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/):

> Material for MkDocs follows the **sponsorware** release strategy, which means
> that new features are first exclusively released to sponsors as part of
> [Insiders](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/#what-is-insiders).
> Read on to learn [what sponsorships
> achieve](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/#what-sponsorships-achieve), [how to
> become a sponsor](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/#how-to-become-a-sponsor)
> to get access to Insiders, and [what's in it for
> you](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/#whats-in-it-for-me)!
>
> **What is Insiders?**
>
> Material for MkDocs Insiders is a private fork of Material for MkDocs, hosted as a private
> GitHub repository. [Almost](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/#fn:1) [all new
> features](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/#whats-in-it-for-me) are developed
> as part of this fork, which means that they are immediately available to all eligible sponsors, as
> they are made collaborators of this repository.
>
> Every feature is tied to a [funding
> goal](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/#funding) in monthly subscriptions.
> When a funding goal is hit, the features that are tied to it are merged back into Material for
> MkDocs and released for general availability, making them available to all users. Bugfixes are
> always released in tandem.
