# JupyterLab

## Project URL

[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

## Project description

JupyterLab is a highly extensible, feature-rich notebook authoring application and editing
environment, and is a part of [Project Jupyter](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/),
a large umbrella project centered around the goal of providing tools (and
[standards](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/#sub-project-documentation)) for interactive
computing with [computational notebooks](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/#what-is-a-notebook).

A computational notebook is a shareable document that combines computer code, plain language
descriptions, data, rich visualizations like 3D models, charts, graphs and figures, and interactive
controls. A notebook, along with an editor like JupyterLab, provides a fast interactive environment
for prototyping and explaining code, exploring and visualizing data, and sharing ideas with others.

JupyterLab is a sibling to other notebook authoring applications under the Project Jupyter
umbrella, like [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Jupyter
Desktop](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop). JupyterLab offers a more advanced,
feature rich, customizable experience compared to Jupyter Notebook.

## Installation instructions

First, [install
Micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html).
Please note that Micromamba installation and configuration instructions
are outside of the scope of this document, although this page assumes the
`MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX` environment variable is set to `~/.prefix/sw/mamba` (see example
[`~/.zshrc`](https://github.com/manselmi/notes/blob/main/assets/.zshrc) configuration file). Also,
here is an example [`~/.mambarc`](https://github.com/manselmi/notes/blob/main/assets/.mambarc)
configuration file.

Let's create an isolated environment in which we'll install JupyterLab, and then remove JupyterLab's
default kernels.

``` shell
micromamba create --name jupyterlab -- jupyterlab
find -- "${MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX}/envs/jupyterlab/share/jupyter/kernels" -mindepth 1 -delete
```

Create some directories we'll need.

``` shell
mkdir -p -- "${HOME}/.jupyterlab" "${HOME}/Documents/Jupyter" "${HOME}/Library/LaunchAgents"
```

Add this [JupyterLab configuration
file](https://github.com/manselmi/notes/blob/main/assets/jupyterlab/jupyter_lab_config.py) to the
`~/.jupyter` directory.

Now let's create a launchd service that will make it easy to automatically start and stop
JupyterLab. Add this [JupyterLab launchd service
definition](https://github.com/manselmi/notes/blob/main/assets/jupyterlab/org.jupyter.jupyterlab.server.plist)
to the `~/Library/LaunchAgents` directory.

If you would like to learn more about launchd, please see [Creating Launch Daemons and
Agents](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html).

The launchd service we created will run when loaded, so let's load the service:

``` shell
launchctl bootstrap "gui/$(id -u)/" ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.jupyter.jupyterlab.server.plist
```

Please note that upon future logins, the service will automatically be loaded and hence
automatically started.

Now let's confirm that JupyterLab is up and running. Navigate your browser to
[http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888). If you see a JupyterLab page, then so far so good.

## Register Python environment with JupyterLab

Let's create a Python environment specific to the `foo` project. In addition to Python, the
environment must contain [`ipykernel`](https://ipykernel.readthedocs.io).

``` shell
micromamba create --name foo -- 'python=3.12.*' ipykernel
```

Now create a kernel to register the environment with JupyterLab.

``` { .shell .annotate }
micromamba run --name foo \  # (1)!
  python -m ipykernel install --user \
    --name foo \  # (2)!
    --display-name Foo  # (3)!
```

1. The conda environment name is `foo`.

2. The kernel name is set to `foo`.

3. The kernel display name is set to `Foo`.

Now let's confirm that we can start a notebook using our new kernel. Navigate your browser to
[http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888). You should see a screen like this with the `Foo`
kernel available.

<figure markdown>
  ![](/assets/jupyterlab/landing-page.png)
</figure>

Create a new notebook with the `Foo` kernel and run something simple like `1+1`.

Congratulations! ðŸ¥³

## Maintenance

Routine maintenance tasks may be automated with [Task](https://taskfile.dev) and these
[taskfiles](https://github.com/manselmi/notes/tree/main/assets/taskfile). Add those taskfiles
to the `~/.taskfile` directory (create it if necessary), and ensure that the environment
variables `TASKFILE_LIBRARY_ROOT_DIR` and `TASKFILE_INCLUDE_ROOT_DIR` are set as in
[`~/.zshrc`](https://github.com/manselmi/notes/blob/main/assets/.zshrc).

Here are some common tasks:

To stop the JupyterLab service, run:

``` shell
task -d "${TASKFILE_LIBRARY_ROOT_DIR}/jupyterlab" launchctl:bootout
```

To start the JupyterLab service (if not already running), run:

``` shell
task -d "${TASKFILE_LIBRARY_ROOT_DIR}/jupyterlab" launchctl:bootstrap
```

To upgrade the JupyterLab conda environment and remove any default kernel, run:

``` shell
pushd -- "${TASKFILE_LIBRARY_ROOT_DIR}/jupyterlab"
task launchctl:bootout
task micromamba:upgrade
task micromamba:sync
task remove-default-kernels
task launchctl:bootstrap
popd
```

To perform the previous operations with a single command, run:

``` shell
task -d "${TASKFILE_LIBRARY_ROOT_DIR}/jupyterlab" upgrade
```

To disable JupyterLab, within `~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.jupyter.jupyterlab.server.plist` change

``` xml
	<key>Disabled</key>
	<false/>
```

to

``` xml
	<key>Disabled</key>
	<true/>
```

then run:

``` shell
task -d "${TASKFILE_LIBRARY_ROOT_DIR}/jupyterlab" launchctl:bootout
```

To uninstall JupyterLab, first disable it and then run:

``` shell
micromamba env remove --name jupyterlab
```
