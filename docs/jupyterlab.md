# JupyterLab

## Project URL

[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

## Project description

JupyterLab is a highly extensible, feature-rich notebook authoring application and editing
environment, and is a part of [Project Jupyter](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/),
a large umbrella project centered around the goal of providing tools (and
[standards](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/#sub-project-documentation)) for interactive
computing with [computational notebooks](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/#what-is-a-notebook).

A computational notebook is a shareable document that combines computer code, plain language
descriptions, data, rich visualizations like 3D models, charts, graphs and figures, and interactive
controls. A notebook, along with an editor like JupyterLab, provides a fast interactive environment
for prototyping and explaining code, exploring and visualizing data, and sharing ideas with others.

JupyterLab is a sibling to other notebook authoring applications under the Project Jupyter
umbrella, like [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Jupyter
Desktop](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop). JupyterLab offers a more advanced,
feature rich, customizable experience compared to Jupyter Notebook.

## Installation instructions

First, install [Pixi](https://pixi.sh). Please note that Pixi installation and configuration
instructions are outside of the scope of this document.

Let's create an isolated environment in which we'll install JupyterLab, and then remove JupyterLab's
default kernels. This page assumes the `JUPYTERLAB_ROOT_PREFIX` environment variable is set to
`~/.prefix/sw/jupyterlab` (see the example [`~/.zshrc`]({{ prefix_repo_url("assets/.zshrc") }})
configuration file).

``` { .shell .annotate }
rm -fr -- "${JUPYTERLAB_ROOT_PREFIX}"
mkdir -p -- "${JUPYTERLAB_ROOT_PREFIX}"
pushd -q -- "${JUPYTERLAB_ROOT_PREFIX}"
# Place `taskfile.yaml` here.  (1)!
# Place `pixi.toml` here.  (2)!
pixi update
pixi install
find -- .pixi/envs/default/share/jupyter/kernels -mindepth 1 -delete
popd -q
```

1. [`taskfile.yaml`]({{ prefix_repo_url("assets/jupyterlab/taskfile.yaml") }})

2. [`pixi.toml`]({{ prefix_repo_url("assets/jupyterlab/pixi.toml") }})

Create some directories we'll need.

``` shell
mkdir -p -- "${HOME}/.jupyterlab" "${HOME}/Documents/Jupyter" "${HOME}/Library/LaunchAgents"
```

Add this [JupyterLab configuration
file]({{ prefix_repo_url("assets/jupyterlab/jupyter_lab_config.py") }}) to the `~/.jupyter`
directory.

Now let's create a launchd service that will make it easy to automatically start and stop
JupyterLab. Add this [JupyterLab launchd service
definition]({{ prefix_repo_url("assets/jupyterlab/org.jupyter.jupyterlab.server.plist") }}) to the
`~/Library/LaunchAgents` directory, editing usernames and pathnames as needed.

If you would like to learn more about launchd, please see [Creating Launch Daemons and
Agents](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html).

The launchd service we created will run when loaded, so let's load the service:

``` shell
launchctl bootstrap "gui/$(id -u)/" ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.jupyter.jupyterlab.server.plist
```

Please note that upon future logins, the service will automatically be loaded and hence
automatically started.

Now let's confirm that JupyterLab is up and running. Navigate your browser to
[http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888). If you see a JupyterLab page, then so far so good.

## Register Python environment with JupyterLab

Let's create a Python environment specific to the `foo` project. In addition to Python, the
environment must contain [`ipykernel`](https://ipykernel.readthedocs.io).

``` shell
pixi init
pixi add -- 'python[version=3.12.*]' ipykernel
```

Now create a kernel to register the environment with JupyterLab.

``` { .shell .annotate }
pixi run -- python -m ipykernel install --user \
  --name foo \  # (1)!
  --display-name Foo  # (2)!
```

1. The kernel name is set to `foo`.

2. The kernel display name is set to `Foo`.

Now let's confirm that we can start a notebook using our new kernel. Navigate your browser to
[http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888). You should see a screen like this with the `Foo`
kernel available.

<figure markdown>
  ![](/assets/jupyterlab/landing-page.png)
</figure>

Create a new notebook with the `Foo` kernel and run something simple like `1+1`.

Congratulations! ðŸ¥³

## Maintenance

Routine maintenance tasks may be automated with [Task](https://taskfile.dev) and these
[taskfiles](https://github.com/manselmi/taskfile-library/tree/main/include). Place those taskfile
directories in the `~/.taskfile/include` directory (create it if necessary), and ensure that the
environment variable `TASKFILE_INCLUDE_ROOT_DIR` is set to the same directory, as in
[`~/.zshrc`]({{ prefix_repo_url("assets/.zshrc") }}).

Here are some common tasks:

To stop the JupyterLab service, run:

``` shell
task -d "${JUPYTERLAB_ROOT_PREFIX}" launchctl:bootout
```

To start the JupyterLab service (if not already running), run:

``` shell
task -d "${JUPYTERLAB_ROOT_PREFIX}" launchctl:bootstrap
```

To upgrade the JupyterLab environment and remove any default kernel, run:

``` shell
pushd -q -- "${JUPYTERLAB_ROOT_PREFIX}"
task launchctl:bootout
task pixi:update
task pixi:install
task remove-default-kernels
task launchctl:bootstrap
popd -q
```

To perform the previous operations with a single command, run:

``` shell
task -d "${JUPYTERLAB_ROOT_PREFIX}" upgrade
```

To disable JupyterLab, within `~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.jupyter.jupyterlab.server.plist` change

``` xml
	<key>Disabled</key>
	<false/>
```

to

``` xml
	<key>Disabled</key>
	<true/>
```

then run:

``` shell
task -d "${JUPYTERLAB_ROOT_PREFIX}" launchctl:bootout
```

To uninstall JupyterLab, first disable it and then run:

``` shell
task -d "${JUPYTERLAB_ROOT_PREFIX}" pixi:clean
```
